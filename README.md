I managed to get a lot of the functionallity working, but I wasn't able to get the
multiple files to upload to the main directory. Originally, I uploaded the file_name and
a binary conversion of the image file to save in the database. The rest of the login functionality with encrypted sign-ins for users
is there though. Run app.py in the directory to get the flask application running.
